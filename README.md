# Jsoniter Scala 

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala) [![code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala) [![license](http://img.shields.io/:license-Apache%202-green.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

Scala macros that generates `com.jsoniter.spi.Decoder` and `com.jsoniter.spi.Encoder` interfaces in compile time,
based on compile time reflection.

Main goal is to provide a static code generation for Scala case classes, standard types and collections
to get maximum performance of JSON parsing & serialization.

## Features and limitations
- JSON parsing from `Array[Byte]` or `java.io.InputStream` using `com.jsoniter.JsonIterator`
- JSON serialization to `Array[Byte]` or `java.io.OutputStream` using `com.jsoniter.JsonStream`
- Support of UTF-8 encoding 
- Parsing of strings with escaped characters for JSON field names, keys & values 
- Configurable serialization of strings with escaped UTF-8 characters to support other ASCII based encodings
- Configurable indenting of output
- Case classes should be defined as a top-level class or directly inside of another class or object
- Enums, `BigInt`, `BigDecimal`, `Option`, Scala collections & arrays as class fields are supported
- Types that supported as map keys: primitives, enums, `String`, `BigInt`, `BigDecimal` and value classes for them  
- Fields with default values that defined in a constructor are optional, other fields are required (no special annotation required)
- Fields with default values, empty options & empty collections/arrays are not serialized to provide sparse output 
- Fields can be annotated as transient or just not defined in constructor to avoid parsing and serializing at all 
- Need to materialize for all case classes used in nested structures
- Key names can be overridden by field annotation
- TODO: generate encoders/decoders recursively from top-level type
- TODO: support on top-level for values, collections & arrays to avoid wrapping to redundant case classes
- TODO: implicitly resolvable encoders/decoders for field types and map keys
- TODO: efficient specialized immutable list & set for primitive types

## How to use

Build and publish locally for both Scala versions (release to Sonatype repo is coming)

```sh
sbt clean +publishLocal
```

Add the library to your dependencies list

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.github.plokhotnyuk.jsoniter-scala" %% "macros" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

Generate some serializers for your case classes
    
```scala
import com.github.plokhotnyuk.jsoniter_scala.Codec

case class User(name: String)

val userCodec = Codec.materialize[User]
```

That's it! You have generated an instance of `com.github.plokhotnyuk.jsoniter_scala.Codec` which implements both
`com.jsoniter.spi.Decoder` and `com.jsoniter.spi.Encoder` interfaces for your `User`.

Now you can use it:

```scala
userCodec.read("""{"name":"John"}""".getBytes("UTF-8"))
userCodec.write(User(name = "John"))
```

To see generated code add the following line to your sbt build file

```sbt
scalaOptions += "-Xmacro-settings:print-codecs"
```
